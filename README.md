# ABOUT

An (un)balanced mod based on random suggestions from smash Twitter. Your main could be fun as hell now. Or a lot worse. Or maybe just completely broken! I'm mainly doing this to familiarise myself with Ultimate modding in case I ever want to do something seriously in the future.

# CHANGELOG

Written in alphabetical order as I cba to look up roster order by the way

## Key
